!!! Note
    This list is not comprehensive and is intended to provide a baseline of tools we'll use throughout our documentation, labs, and content. Some of these things may end up rarely used, but we do intend to use them. While we're focusing on Blue Team Engineering work, we will heavily rely on red team tools to perform validation against our expected configurations. Some call this purple teaming, I just call it due-dilligence.
