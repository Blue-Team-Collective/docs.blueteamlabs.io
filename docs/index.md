# Welcome to the Lab Guide

Welcome to the Blue Team Labs Wiki, lab build guide, and documentation. The purpose of this documentation is to provide a go-to resource for security engineering and architecture professionals to leverage for replicating the environment we used for providing training content. 

We hope to provide extensive resources and training that help develop your blue and purple team skills and help bridge a gap. For far too long, security skills have been focused on red-teaming or detection and response (a small component of blue teaming).

## About Blue Team Labs
Blue Team Labs, a special directive of the Blue Team Collective, is focused on providing training content, resources, and troubleshooting aids for the often neglected blue team members--the engineers and architects. 

## About Blue Team Collective
My end-goal with Blue Team Collective and Blue Team Labs is a robust and comprehensive training platform that allows users to provision short term sandboxes of industry leading security products. Engineers and architects need access to a robust set of resources to learn how to configure, operate, administer, and maintain them. I hope to provide this with "Blue Team Collective", the parent project for "Blue Team Labs".


### Forgetting Someone?
Far too often Blue Teams are thought of as solely the analyst or operater. Evidenced by the fact that most training platforms only provide access to security operations tools for learning analyst, researcher, or operator skillsets. While CTFs are great and do provide a great resource for many, engineering teams need more.

### Trials
While many services to offer limited trials, there are many issues with this:

*  Limited time-length, generally between 14 and 30 days long.
* Certain features are often not available to trial tenants.
* Each platform needs to be registered for independently, with no single sign on support.
* Often, trials require a credit-card on file and if you forget to cancel before the trial period is up, you might be out a decent amount of your own money.
* Many trials are locked behind having to provide your personal information to a sales representative who you have no intention of ever interacting with.

### Sandboxes Instead of Trials
Engineers and Architects need sandboxes. Failure and repetition are some of the best training mechanisms available to us---with limited time, features, or licensing, it's hard to build a comprehensive lab that tests the boundaries of our skills. Whether its a trial license that only provides one user, or a live demo platform that doesn't allow you to interact or configure anything, we deserve more.

### High Bars for Entry
While large enterprises might have the resources available for their employees, aspiring engineers and smaller organizations do not. Whether it's funding, access to professional networking, or strict business requirements, everyday engineers and architects are at a significant disadvantage and risk falling behind the curve in and ever evolving landscape.

### Vision
This is where I my vision for Blue Team Collective arrives. I want to solve this by creating a platform where users can provision trial resources using a centralized account for as many of the services as they need. 

While the platform likely won't be free unless we receive a wave of generosity from vendors, we hope it'll be a small fee and we'll try to make it as non-subscription like as possible as I think we've all grown to hate the ever increasing monthly subscription nightmare.

#### Envisioned Features
* A centralized platform to provision sandboxes for apps across many different vendors.
* Playbooks to help build labs and get data into your environment so you can start working with real live data instead of demo data.
* A single-sign on or closely integrated platform that allows you to login with a single authentication method and not have to manage each sandbox indiviually.
* Follow along labs that allow you to double-check you work to understand best practice configurations, where something went wrong, and how to do better next time.
* Access to industry leading software and hardware from vendors like Microsoft, CrowdStrike, Palo 
Alto Networks, Cisco, SentinelOne, Fortinet, Rapid7, Tenable, Okta, Tellix, Splunk, and more.
* 60 - 90 days sandbox licenses so you have a decent amount of time to actually learn things while still having a life. 
* Easy ways to deprovision resources, backup sandboxes, and restore sandboxes upon expiration of older resources.
* Privacy and protection against an influx of calls or emails from sales representatives when all you care about is learning something for your future job.
* Some other really cool sh** too.


### Managing Expectations
Again. These are ambitions. I have no clue where things will go, and perhaps it never gains traction. Whether the platform takes off or not, I'll continue creating content and resources for engineers and architects in hopes that we're able to bridge the skills gap and train the next generation of defenders.

## Seeking Help with Developement
The platform is still in initial requirements building phase. If you would like to work on this project with me, or have suggestions on how we can solve this issue, please feel free to contact me below:

I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible.
