# Trials and Software

Many of the security tools you'll need to learn to be an effective engineer or architect in the enterprise are unfortunately locked behind paywall and arbitrary POV requirements. While this list is not comprehensive, it aims to list all platforms you can receive a trial for, note the trial length, and provide details about limitations or scope of the trial.

For information about specific tools used such as open-source client based applications, visit our "Tools" page for an awesome list of all the useful tools you might need.

    I was unable to find self-service trials for these, but that's not to say you can't get one if you're willing to talk to a sales rep. This is truly a shame considering many of these are some of the most well-known and trusted. I could rant for days about why vendors should allow self-service trials for engineers and architects, but I'll save that for another day.

    What this means for CarbonBlack? Who knows...Hopefully it finds itself in good hands, it was one of the first true EDRs I worked with and did enjoy it once I learned it.


## Network Modeling
<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :simple-cisco:{ .lg .middle .padded-right }__Cisco Modeling Labs__

    ---
    CML is the replacement to VIRL. While you do have to pay for a license if you want to use your own equipement and have a full fledged, enterprise-ready network simulation tool, there is the option to get a temporary sandbox using the DevNet sandbox.

    By now, we all know what Microsoft 365 is, but did you know you can get a free developer sandbox with a fully licensed featureset? Even better, did you know you can renew the sandbox? Perhaps one of the most generous offerings, Microsoft allows you to lab out anything you can imagine with a M365 E5 licensed tenant!

    Google Workspace is one of the only real competitors to Microsoft 365 these days. Even at that, many of their security offerings fall far short of that which Microsoft provides. Whether your organization uses workspace or you want to set up a secure and robust email solution for your family, Workspace offers a 14-day trial.

    A lesser known competitor in the NGFW space, Barracuda offers a competitive solution. While it's been since 2016/2017 since I tried the solution out, it mirrored much of what you'd expect from a NGFW.

    Let's be real, there's a ton of NGFW solutions out there. It would be impossible to cover all of them, find the right trial link, and share some thoughts on them as it's simply impossible for me to try them all out.
    
    Here's some honorable mentions that might be worth looking into. Some of these offer self-service trials, while others require setting up a sales demo or "requesting" a trial. Some also fail to seem competitive in a modern saturated market. At the end of the day, if you need to learn one, there's options available.

    Greenbone, formerly known as OpenVAS, is an open-source vulnerability scanner that allows for identifying CWEs and CVEs. OpenVAS can perform credentialed and non-credential scans for vulnerabilities and compliance via SCAP. Greenbone can be deployed in a flexible manner depending on licensing and deployment criteria. Unfortunately, the community version no longer comes in an appliance form, and needs to be run via docker or installing from source.

I'm not sure why vendors think that administrators can get a solid grasp of a tool in such short time, but it's what we deal with. For a less feature-packed version, you can get the Nessus essentials scanner which allows you to scan up to 16 IPs. It is locked down, but is fully licensed and usable.

    The primary reason these solutions end up in the "Honorable Mentions" section is that they don't offer a free self-service trial or a limited version. This is my way of "shunning" companies for making the barrier to entry higher. To some extent, I do understand. As companies move code and platforms to public cloud providers, it becomes cost prohibitive to offer free self-service trials. It's still frustrating though for those of us trying to sharpen our skates on the security engineering and architecture side.

## Virtualization
<div class="grid cards" markdown>

    Hyper-V has gained some traction over the years primarily due to the licensing benefits. Despite this, it's not as mature of a solution as Proxmox or ESXi on the enterprise side.

!!! Note "End of Standalone Hyper-V"
    Microsoft has decided to end support for standalone Hyper-V servers.[^3] This doesn't mean the end of Hyper-V, it just means their cut down version of Windows designed specifically for Hyper-V will no longer be available. You'll still be able to install the role on any modern Windows system that supports virtualization.


## Privacy Tips
When signing up for trials, we're often asked for our personal information. While it may violate terms of service for each respective platform, using aliases may help alleviate some of the issues created by adding yourself to every database conceived by mankind.

Check with the terms of service of the trial before continuing, but consider the following:

* Provide alias names, i.e if your name is Jon Smith, maybe change your name you signed up with to "Bob Smithburger"
* Provide alias email addresses. Never provide your true email address if possible. Services like fastmail and others make this possible with ease.
* Provide non-functional phone numbers. If you're asked for your phone number when signing up for a service, consider using a virtual line from Google Voice or something similar. Better, use a well known phone number such as those sang in songs.
* Use separate browser profiles, or separate browsers altogether. This is a whole rabbit hole I could go down, but everything you do is catalouged, take some minor steps to minimize and distance yourself. We can't stop all of it, but we can take some simple steps to mitigate it.
* If a service asks for a credit card to sign up, consider whether a virtual card provider such as privacy.com suites your needs. They offer easy ways to limit spend, close cards when you're done with them, and mask your true financial details from the platform.

## Want Something Added?
I've got a number of things I'm working on getting added here as I've still got to write-up a short description of some of them and get the correct links for free trials where available. 

If you see something you wanted added, submit a pull request on our Github page and we'll review it and get it added promptly.
